I have included your firmware directly in this folder. Do not change the name and load directly onto your sd card. 

turn off printer and insert sd with the firmware in while its off (make sure you unplug octoprint).

Power on your printer and screen should turn blue (not sure what it does on v2) 

In the event that your language switches to chinese follow the below video at timestamp 10:37
